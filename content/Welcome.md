In a realm of fantasy beings that could shatter mortal minds crafted and shaped the land. Gods that are spoken about in stories haven’t been seen in over 5,000 years, but their remnants are scattered throughout the land. Today, these powerful remnants are sought out for profit by many, but powerful factions govern these remnants within the society. This doesn’t stop one destructive group in particular to claim it all for their own. With an election on it’s way for a new faction representative there might be a way to stop them with the right help.
